The assignment is about using STM32 development board that can be placed directly on a vibrating machine such as fan to learn its vibration patterns. After learning the pattern, they will be used as signal samples to allow AI machine (NanoEdge AI Library) to analyze the pattern and recognize or detect potential anomalies in its behavior. The equipment required to complete the assignment are the STM32 Nucleo Development (STM32L432KC), 3-axis MEMS accelerometer LIS3DH and any computer that running Microsoft WindowsÂ® 10 (and above) with minimum of 8GB RAM running STM32CubeIDE, Arduino software and NanoEdge AI Studio software.
